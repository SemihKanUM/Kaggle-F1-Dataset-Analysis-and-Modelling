# üèéÔ∏è Formula 1 Data Analysis

This repository explores Formula 1 racing data through three main notebooks. **Please check the files with .ipynb extension too see the work**  
The project covers **circuit overtaking analysis**, **pit stop performance evaluation**, and **predictive modeling**.

## üìÇ Contents

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Circuit Analysis  
**`1-circuit_analysis.ipynb`**  
- Analyzes Formula 1 circuits to determine where drivers experience the **least or most position changes** between start and finish.  
- Focuses on post-2011 races with reliable datasets.  
- Identifies circuits like **Monaco** and **Albert Park** as hardest to overtake, while others show higher variability.  
- Includes visualization of circuits ranked by average overtaking difficulty.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pit Stop Analysis  
**`2-Pitstop Analysis.ipynb`**  
- Investigates the impact of **pit stop performance** on race results.  
- Filters post-2011 races where pit stop data is available.  
- Examines correlations between stop duration, number of stops, and final race position.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling  
**`3-model.ipynb`**  
- Prepares cleaned race datasets for **machine learning models**.  
- Focuses on completed races (status = finished).  
- Builds predictive approaches to estimate race outcomes using historical race and pit stop data.
